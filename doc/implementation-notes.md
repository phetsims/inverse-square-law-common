# Inverse Square Law - Implementation Notes

This is the common library of all inverse square law sims: Coulomb's Law, Gravity Force Lab, and Gravity Force Lab
Basics. Due to the needs of the inheriting sims, it's common to pass in large option objects to allow for freedom
between the different requirements.

## Model

First, see the model overview at https://github.com/phetsims/inverse-square-law-common/blob/main/doc/model.md

The most fundamental interaction is between the two `ISLCObject`s within the `ISLCModel` space. The objects can only
move in 1D and are constrained by the bounds of the sim as well as the nearest edge of the other object. The model's
step function handles these constraints as well as force calculation and triggering the necessary events for visual
updates.

While the objects have defined radii, the force calculation is based on their center-to-center distance.

In model coordinates, 0 is the the center between the two `ISLCObject`s

## View

The scene graph construction is handled in inheriting sims, and ISLC repo simply creates the common Nodes that they use.

### ISLCObjectNode

These consist of a circle, a puller and rope, a force readout, and an arrow that visually corresponds to the force
direction and magnitude. The puller is an ordered array of images that are invisible; by mapping force values to
indices, we can set the visibility of the puller image that corresponds to the force value.

Force ranges are required for the mapping functions for the arrow width and puller indices.

### Auditory Descriptions

This "view" output was added after initial development of this sim suite. The majority of the logic to achieve this
output modality is in three places.

* `*Describer.js` types are responsible for forming output strings from the model or describer specific state.
* `*AlertManager.js` types provide the majority of interface with aria-live alerts via
  `SCENERY_PHET/utteranceQueue`. Alert managers often use describers to form the strings they alert.
* New listeners often need to be added in parallel to traditional mouse/touch listeners to support alternative input.
  When the adding of listeners is already done in common code, then it is as simple as providing options to those common
  code elements. `ISLCObjectNode` mixes in `AccessibleSlider` directly to add the proper listeners for the interaction.
  Whereas for `GFLB/GFLBMassControl`, the accessibility-related listeners are added via `NumberPicker`.

## Query Parameters

We offer some development assistance with the query parameters that toggle the snapping grid for the sim and displaying
the design mockup. See `ISLCQueryParameters.js` for details.

## Disposal

No screen Nodes or model objects are ever destroyed from the start of the sim, instead Properties are reset to initial
values. Because of this, there is no need to dispose listeners, and memory management is not an issue.
